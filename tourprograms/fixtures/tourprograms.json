            "description": "Hiking – Midnight sun We travel by minibus and walk about 3-4 km along the mountain Luossavaaras east side. After the path up to the mountain there is much to see and experience in terms of nature (flora, fauna, geology), history of the mine and facts about the future of the city. On the top we have the best view to see the midnight sun, there we enjoy a cup of coffee/tea and a lovely reindeer meat sandwich and for dessert a delicious homemade Kiruna Sunset Cake with cream and cloudberries.",
